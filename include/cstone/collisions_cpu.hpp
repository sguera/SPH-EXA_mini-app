/*! \brief For each leaf node enlarged by its halo radius, find all colliding leaf nodes
 *
 * @tparam I            32- or 64-bit unsigned integer
 * @param internalTree  internal binary tree
 * @param tree          sorted Morton codes representing the leaves of the (global) octree
 * @param haloRadii     halo search radii per leaf node, length = nNodes(tree)
 * @return              list of colliding node indices for each leaf node
 *
 * This is a CPU version that can be OpenMP parallelized.
 * In the GPU version, the for-loop body is designed such that one GPU-thread
 * can be launched for each for-loop element.
