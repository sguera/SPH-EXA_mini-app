# SPH

The smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique is a purely Lagrangian method.
SPH discretizes a fluid in a series of interpolation points (SPH particles) 
whose distribution follows the mass density of the fluid and their evolution relies 
on a weighted interpolation over close neighboring particles.

SPH simulations represent computationally demanding calculations. 
Therefore, trade-offs are made between temporal and spatial scales, resolution, 
dimensionality (3-D or 2-D), and approximated versions of the physics involved. 
The parallelization of SPH codes is not trivial due to their boundless nature 
and the absence of a structured particle grid. 
[SPHYNX](https://astro.physik.unibas.ch/sphynx/), 
[ChaNGa](http://faculty.washington.edu/trq/hpcc/tools/changa.html), 
and [SPH-flow](http://www.sph-flow.com) are the three SPH codes selected in the PASC SPH-EXA project proposal. 
The performance of these codes is negatively impacted by factors, such as multiple time-stepping and gravity. 
Therefore, the goal is to extrapolate their common basic SPH features, which are consolidated in a fully optimized, Exascale-ready, MPI+X, pure-SPH, mini-app. 

# SPH-EXA mini-app

SPH-EXA mini-app is a C++14 headers-only code with no external software dependencies. 
The parallelism is currently expressed via MPI+OpenMP.

You can use the following commands to compile and run the SquarePatch example:

#### Compile

* OpenMP: ```shell make omp```
* MPI+OpenMP: ```shell make mpi+omp```
* MPI+OpenMP+OpenMP 4.5 Offloading: ```shell make mpi+omp+target```

#### Run

* OpenMP: ```shell bin/omp.app```
* MPI+OpenMP: ```shell mpirun bin/mpi+omp.app```
* MPI+OpenMP+OpenMP 4.5 Offloading: ```shell mpirun bin/mpi+omp+target.app```
